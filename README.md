## SlimeE

SlimeE is a WIP plugin working to improve and build upon EquiTech, an abandoned project by Sefiraat.
The goal is to bring back many of features of Equivalent Exchange (ProjectE) that 

## Features
The plugin currently features:
* EMC!
  * Turn any unwanted items into EMC
  * Synthesize your stored EMC into any other item you want!
  * Server owners have full control over the base EMC values of items
  * Items that are crafted have their EMC generated based off of these base values (e.g. Diamond = 1000 emc, Diamond Block will automatically be 9000)
  * Server owners can override this behavior if required by adding the item into the base.
* Transmutation Orb
  * This key item lets users input their unwanted items to convert them to EMC.
  * The first time a new item is added, it is 'learned'.
  * Learned items can be synthesized using stored EMC.
* Dissolution Chest
  * Any items placed/hopped/transferred via cargo into this chest will slowly be dissolved into EMC added directly into the players EMC pool
* Condensate Chest
  * Shift + Click a Condensate chest with an item to assign its production type. Assuming the player has enough EMC and the item can be synthesized, the items will begin production.
* Slimefun
  * If Slimefun is installed, this plugin's recipes will be added to the Slimefun Guide. **This plugin does not require Slimefun to run**
* General fixes compared to the original
  * Fixes several documented (and undocumented) bugs in EquiTech, and built against the latest versions

## Planned Features/Changes
* Slimefun Addon
  * Move SlimeE from standalone to a full Slimefun addon
* Automation Upgrades
  * Upgrades to MK2 - MK3 chests for faster throughput
* Modify to bring closer to EE
  * Transmutation Table, Energy Collector, Energy Condensor
